# 🌿 IoT Greenhouse

*A project by the Bearzi Innovation Team*

YouTube video of the project: https://youtu.be/BA7I3dpSf6I


## 📘 Project Overview

The **IoT Greenhouse** is a smart greenhouse designed for the remote management of small plants. It integrates sensors, actuators, and a web interface to monitor and control environmental conditions efficiently and sustainably.

This project combines **informatics, electronics, and mechatronics** to create an accessible, educational, and eco-friendly system.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Enable **remote control and monitoring** of the greenhouse via a web interface.
* Include an **alarm and environmental control system** for safety and automation.
* Promote **sustainable plant cultivation** through optimized water and electricity usage.
* Use **accessible hardware and open-source technologies** such as **Node.js**, **React**, and **Raspberry Pi**.

---

## 🧩 Learning Goals

Beyond the technical results, the project aimed to provide hands-on experience in:

* Team collaboration and project management
* Defining and achieving short- and medium-term goals
* Sharing knowledge and skills
* Developing self-learning abilities with new technologies
